    "text": "The United States is widely categorized as having a free market capitalist economy. This generally means that private individuals and firms control the factors of production and that the law of supply and demand, instead of central government planning, determines prices and quantities of goods and services produced. In many markets, multiple private firms compete for customers, forcing prices down. United States federal government spending is lower as a percent of GDP than in other advanced, rich economies, such as the OECD, hovering at around 20%. Nonetheless, Americans seem to credit or blame the president for the economy’s performance and “the president’s handling of the economy” is one of the most closely tracked metrics of political pundits. I tend to believe that a president has marginal, if any, impact on economic results and that short-term economic results are largely out of the control of the federal government. Moreover, I suspect that Americans’ evaluations of economic performance are laregly driven by vibes rather than understanding the actual facts.\nThis article will examine multiple economic indicators to establish baseline facts about economic performance by president. This article uses data queried from the Federal Reserve’s Economic Data API, fredapi, hosted by the St. Louis Federal Reserve.\nSeveral different data time series are collected from FRED. These raw series are plotted below along with grey bars representing recessions.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe blue dashed line represents the average annual growth rate of real GDP over the timespan displayed.
